# Analysis
The aim for this investigation was to derive the historical importance of score to the success of a team. Obviously one needs to outscore their opponent, but by how much? When can we say that a team has accrued enough points to have a greater than 50% chance of winning the match?

A suitable technique for this line of enquiry is linear logistic regression. We begin by stating the sigmoid function that will model the probability of winning the match, as a function of a teamâ€™s score, as

Where Z is given by the linear combination,

where X is a teams score.

We proceed to derive the coefficients beta naught and beta one by maximising the log likelihood for a Bernoulli random variable, since the labels we are predicting are binary in nature. The likelihood can be stated as,

The negation of this function was mininised using `SciPy.optimise` and the BFGS methodology.
